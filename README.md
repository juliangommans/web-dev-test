# web-dev-test

This test is part of the selection process for a Web Developer position with ShowGizmo. 

Ahead of the interview we would appreciate it if you can complete this test project – we've kept it simple so should not take more than 1-2 hours maximum.

##Form Client
 
Please fork this repo, commit your code, push and then let James (james@showgizmo.com) know.
 
We would like you to:
 
1. Create a mobile-friendly HTML page with a form
    - what data the form collects does not really matter
 
2. Write some code in your language or framework of choice that will submit form data via AJAX
    - the endpoint to post to is https://web-dev-test.herokuapp.com/forms
    - the form data should be JSON-encoded and structured like { "form": { "your data here" } }
    
3. Display the response in a mobile-friendly HTML page, in human-readable format.

If you have any questions or need clarification about what is required, email James at the above email address.
